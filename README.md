# Donkey-Kong-Ver1
Donkey Kong Game write in C++

In this exercise we were required to implement a basic "Donkey Kong" game as a console application.
The game includes the basic flow of a "Donkey Kong" game like: jumping and climbing, self moving barrels, pause and play, limited lives, fall damage and barrel explosions when fall damaged.
The goal of the game is to reach the princess "Pauline" and save her from "Donkey Kong".
The code was implemented in C++ using functions that were introduced to us in the lectures and the lab classes and including functions that were required in the exercise requirements.
